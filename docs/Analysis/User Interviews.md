To find out what users wanted from their social media, I reached out to users online through an anonymous chat platform to glean an insight into how they feel about the current system and what would they would change. Delving into user emotions and aspirations is crucial to designing a platform that resonates and engages with them.

**User One:**

**Q: How do you keep in contact with people?**

A: I prefer spending time on gaming content rather than engaging with the often controversial or irrelevant topics that dominate social media feeds.

### Takeaways

From the interviews conducted, it has become apparent that many users of social media platforms feel misunderstood and neglected by the companies operating these platforms. The issue at hand is that major social media giants, often referred to as "Big Social Media," have been known to treat users as a product rather than valued customers. Their primary focus lies in monetizing user data and attention, often at the expense of user experience and satisfaction.

When a company fails to prioritize the needs and concerns of its users, it breeds a sense of disillusionment among the user base. Users who were once enthusiastic about the platform begin to feel that their voices are unheard and their preferences are disregarded. This disconnect between the company and its users can lead to a significant erosion of trust and loyalty.

The problem is exacerbated by the sheer size and market dominance of these social media behemoths. Due to their massive user bases and substantial resources, they may not feel the urgency to address the grievances of a subset of disgruntled users. The loss of a few dissatisfied individuals may seem insignificant in the grand scheme of their operations.

However, this complacency can prove to be detrimental in the long run. As the dissatisfaction spreads among the user base, it can lead to a gradual exodus of the most engaged and discerning users, often referred to as "connoisseurs." These are the individuals who deeply appreciate and understand the nuances of social media platforms, and their departure can significantly diminish the value proposition of the platform.

If left unaddressed, this trend can create a vicious cycle, where the platform becomes less appealing to the remaining users, leading to further disengagement and erosion of the user base. Ultimately, the companies that fail to listen to and cater to their users may find themselves losing their competitive edge and struggling to maintain relevance in an ever-evolving digital landscape.



### Potential Biases

It is important to recognise that the surveys were conducted on an anonymous chat platform where, like User 4 mentioned, people lack accountability as to their words. The anonymity afforded by online chat platforms may disproportionately attract users who already harbor negative perceptions of mainstream social media. This can lead to sampling bias, where the interview participants do not fully represent the diversity of perspectives across the broader user population. Researchers must acknowledge the potential for the sample pool to exclude certain demographics and moderate opinions. Care should be taken to ensure balanced representation where possible.

Users who voluntarily participate in interviews, forums, or focus groups inherently possess certain underlying motivations and personality traits that set them apart from non-participants. This self-selection introduces bias, as the data gathered disproportionately represents users already inclined toward sharing opinions and engaging with market research. Researchers must remain cognizant of how self-selection shapes observed trends and themes. Where possible, random sampling and other bias mitigation methods should be applied.
