# Social Social Media
##### My NEA Project for A2

This repository is for my Non-Exam Assessment (NEA) project for A2 A Level Computer Science AQA. It aims to provide the specifics of creating a social media system that focuses on human-centric values rooted in user control, privacy, and meaningful engagement that exist without the detrimental negative aspects of existing platforms.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
###### Project Overview

The project represents the culmination of the knowledge and skills I have acquired during the A Level Computer Science course. With it, I intend to showcase my understanding of computer science concepts such as software development methodologies, data structures, algorithms, database management and web technologies.

My project is centred around designing and developing a user-friendly social media system that delivers a positive experience and is better than other existing social media platforms. In the documentation, I discuss how I have applied myself to design and implement a system that puts users in control, promotes privacy, and allows honest conversations between users.

###### Key Features

- User-generated content creation and sharing

- Private chatrooms for one-on-one communication

- Relationship management system (friendships and followings)

- Customisable feed algorithms

- User engagement through likes and views

- Real-time updates and notifications

- Comprehensive search functionality

- Responsive and cross-compatible interfaces

- Open and well-documented API

These traits demonstrate the ability to apply computer science concepts to address challenges and develop an impactful, novel software product.
<br />
<br />
The repository includes comprehensive documentation that covers various aspects of the project, including:

- System design and architecture

- Data modelling and database design

- Algorithm design and implementation

- Testing and evaluation

- User interface and user experience design

- Security and privacy considerations

- Future enhancements and optimisations

The documentation showcases my ability to analyse requirements, design solutions, and communicate technical concepts.

###### Conclusion

The Social Social Media project exemplifies my A2 A Level Computer Science AQA NEA, which demonstrates my capability to not only competently write code but also examine existing systems and clearly understand how they could be improved to enhance functionality or experience. The development of this project has been heavily influenced by my vision of how social networking platforms should be developed in the future. Therefore, my motivation for creating it lies in the philosophy that social media exists to enable users to communicate effectively, openly, and honestly with one another within their terms of control without compromising their privacy or interest and keeping them engaged in meaningful interactions. For a deeper look at the project, including source code, design documents, and evaluation, see the documentation and code at this repository.
