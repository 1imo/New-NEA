# Social Social Media
##### A2 CS NEA Project

This repository is for my Non-Exam Assessment (NEA) project for A2 A Level Computer Science AQA. It aims to provide the specifics of creating a social media system that focuses on human-centric values rooted in user control, privacy, and meaningful engagement that exist without the detrimental negative aspects of existing platforms.

##### Project Overview

The project represents the culmination of the knowledge and skills I have acquired during the A Level Computer Science course. With it, I intend to showcase my understanding of computer science concepts such as software development methodologies, data structures, algorithms, database management and web technologies.

My project is centred around designing and developing a user-friendly social media system that delivers a positive experience and is better than other social media platforms. In the documentation, I discuss how I have applied myself to design and implement a system that puts users in control, promotes privacy, and allows honest conversations between users.

##### Key Features

- User-generated content creation and sharing

- Private chatrooms for one-on-one communication

- Relationship management system (friendships and followings)

- Customisable feed algorithms

- User engagement through likes and views

- Real-time updates and notifications

- Search functionality

- An extremely responsive user interface

- Open and well-documented API

These traits demonstrate the ability to apply computer science concepts to address challenges and develop an impactful, novel software product.



The repository includes documentation (documentation.odt) that covers aspects of the project, including:

- System design and architecture

- Data modelling and database design

- Algorithm design and implementation

- Testing and evaluation

- User interface and user experience design

- Security and privacy

- Future enhancements and optimisations

The documentation showcases my ability to analyse, design and implement robust solutions using technical concepts to real-world problems.

##### Conclusion

The Social Social Media project showcases my A2 A Level Computer Science AQA NEA. It demonstrates my capability to hopefully write code competently, examine existing systems, and clearly understand how they could be improved to enhance functionality or experience. The development of this project has been heavily influenced by my vision of how social networking platforms should be developed in the future. Therefore, my motivation for creating it lies in the philosophy that social media exists to enable users to communicate effectively, openly, and honestly with one another within their terms of control without compromising their privacy or interest and keeping them engaged in meaningful interactions.

From this project, I have come away with an understanding that systems must be designed beforehand for consistency and thought throughout. My future projects will likely be less haphazard and more planned since testing showed me the discrepancies and weaknesses of my code.
